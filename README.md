# dev-loop

Three autonomous agents — **PM**, **QA**, and **Dev** — that run a software-development
loop **coordinated entirely through Linear ticket state**. They never call each
other directly; Linear is the shared blackboard. Trigger each one manually when
you want that role to take a turn.

```

## The agents

| Skill | What it does |
|---|---|
| **`pm-agent`** | Reads the product's strategy doc, exercises the real product, files **Feature** tickets, **verifies** features that reach `In Review`, and unblocks its own blocked tickets. |
| **`qa-agent`** | Runs happy-path + edge-case tests in the configured test env, files **Bug** tickets, and **re-tests** bugs that reach `In Review`. |
| **`dev-agent`** | Pulls `Todo` tickets in a fixed priority order, grooms them (enough info? duplicate?), implements, runs build/test gates, ships per config, and moves them to `In Review`. Blocks anything it can't act on rather than guessing. |

The full rules — state machine, label taxonomy, ticket templates, priority order,
and the claim / dedupe / blocked protocols — live in
[`references/conventions.md`](references/conventions.md). All three skills read it.

## Safety boundary

The agents operate **only** on tickets carrying the **`dev-loop`** label, scoped to
the configured Linear project. They never read, transition, or comment on any other
ticket. This is the firewall between the loop and your human backlog — treat it as
load-bearing.

## Install

**Quick / dev (this session only):**
```bash
claude --plugin-dir /path/to/dev-loop
```

**Personal, persistent** — via a local marketplace in `~/.claude/settings.json`:
```json
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "local": { "source": { "source": "local", "path": "/path/to/parent-of-dev-loop" } }
  }
}
```
then `/plugin install dev-loop@local`. Verify with `/plugin list`; the skills appear
as `/dev-loop:pm-agent`, `/dev-loop:qa-agent`, `/dev-loop:dev-agent`.

## Configure

Per-project settings live in a user-editable file at
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/projects.json` (resolves to
`~/.claude/plugins/data/dev-loop/projects.json`). Seed it from the shipped example:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/plugins/data/dev-loop
cp config/projects.example.json ~/.claude/plugins/data/dev-loop/projects.json
# then edit: map each Linear project → repo, strategy doc, test env, git/deploy flags, mode
```

Schema + field reference: [`references/config-schema.md`](references/config-schema.md).

Each project has a `mode`:
- **`dry-run`** — agents analyze and print what they *would* do; no Linear writes,
  no push, no deploy. Use this for first contact with a new product.
- **`live`** — agents create/transition tickets and (for Dev) commit/push/deploy
  per the project's `git`/`deploy` flags. A red build/test gate never ships.

## First-run setup

On the first `live` run against a workspace the agents ensure the workflow labels
exist (`dev-loop`, `pm`, `qa`, `edge-case`, `blocked`, `needs-pm`, `needs-qa`;
`Bug`/`Feature`/`Improvement` are reused if present) and that the target Linear
project exists. See `references/conventions.md` §13.

## Status

v0.1.3 — validated end-to-end in an isolated sandbox (one full PM→Dev→QA cycle:
priority pick order, claim, block, per-run cap, verify→Done, cancel, propose+dedupe,
re-test+dedupe all exercised). Autonomy (push/deploy) is opt-in per project via
config and gated on green build/test.

**0.1.1** — hardened against stale strategy docs / test plans (from live-loop
experience): dedupe against the *current product*, not just tickets (conventions
§8); Dev grooming now detects already-built tickets and routes them to `In Review`
instead of rebuilding; PM/QA may legitimately file zero in a run and stay in their
lane (defects → QA, capability gaps → PM, business/infra-blocked items → the user)
rather than padding the backlog.

**0.1.2** — added a PM change-gate preflight (mirrors QA's): when In Review + blocked
are both empty and the repo HEAD is unchanged, PM skips the expensive product sweep
and reports a one-line no-op instead of re-exploring an unchanged build every fire.
Records the explored SHA (not end-of-run HEAD) so a commit shipped mid-run isn't
skipped.

**0.1.3** — PM Job B now *actually unblocks*: when Dev blocks a ticket on a question
or a design/scoping decision PM can answer, PM answers it **and** removes
`blocked`/`needs-pm` (encoding any safety as acceptance criteria — e.g.
build-behind-a-flag-off-by-default) so Dev can proceed. Escalate to the user only
for genuinely human-only calls (irreversible prod ops, money, legal, security
sign-off). Supplying the info **is** the resolution; "answered but left blocked" is
not.
