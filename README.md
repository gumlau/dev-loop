# dev-loop

**English** · [中文](README.zh-CN.md) · [Français](README.fr.md)

**Eleven launchable agents that build, improve, watch, and explain software through a shared
state machine.** You write the intent in a strategy doc and review the result. The agents
propose work, implement it, verify it, ship it, and fold what they learned into the next run.
That is *loop engineering*: less hand-prompting, more running a system that can keep itself
moving.

The agents do not call each other. The **board is the only channel**: every agent reads and
writes ticket state, plus git, so runs can happen in any order and even overlap. Ticket labels
carry the operational facts: eligibility, owner, routing, and dev tier.

## What it is

dev-loop is a **Claude Code plugin** made of role-specialized agents: Product Manager, QA,
Developer(s), and a few coordinators. Together with a small set of conventions, they can run a
complete software-development lifecycle **without a human in the inner loop**. You provide the
product, the strategy doc, and the autonomy settings; the loop turns that into shipped,
verified increments and records what it learned.

It is deliberately **substrate-agnostic**. Coordination can run through **Linear** by default,
a **machine-local file board**, or a **local hub**: an MCP system of record over `node:sqlite`
with per-agent identity and a localhost web UI. The agents and protocols stay the same.

Three rules stay true everywhere:
- **The board is the channel** — agents hand work off through ticket state, not direct calls.
- **Each run starts fresh** — agents are stateless; they re-read the board, git, and disk every
  time, so a crash, reboot, or context compaction does not corrupt the loop.
- **Autonomy means gates, not prompts** — under `autonomy:"full"` the agents decide and act, but
  a red build never ships, a failed deploy rolls back, and a genuinely human-only decision is
  parked on the ticket as a fact instead of becoming an interactive prompt.

## How it works

- **Owner labels route the work.** `pm` owns Features and `qa` owns Bugs. The **owner files
  and verifies**; Dev implements tickets for both. That is how a finished build gets back to
  the person responsible for signing it off.
- **One label is the firewall.** Agents touch **only** tickets carrying the `dev-loop` label,
  scoped to the configured project — never your human backlog.
- **The loop improves itself carefully.** `reflect-agent` studies the loop's behavior and
  curates a per-operator `lessons.md` that every agent reads on the next run. It may edit that
  file autonomously, but it **never** rewrites the agents' own instructions; structural changes
  are proposed for a human to apply.
- **You steer by reviewing.** Agents write daily, weekly, and monthly reports. Add a **点评**
  (critique) next to one, and the agent distills it into a `lessons.md` rule it follows from
  then on.

## The agents

Five **inward** (build-facing) agents, an optional **two-tier Dev**, four **outward**
agents, and a one-time **setup** command. Every agent reads
[`references/conventions.md`](references/conventions.md) first — the full state machine,
label taxonomy, ticket templates, and protocols.

### Inward — the build loop

| Agent | What it does |
|---|---|
| **`pm-agent`** | Reads the strategy doc, exercises the real product, files **Feature** tickets, proactively proposes improvements, **verifies** features that reach `In Review`, unblocks its own blocked tickets, and keeps the strategy doc current. Routes each ticket to a dev tier when the two-tier Dev is on. |
| **`qa-agent`** | Runs happy-path + edge-case tests in the configured test env, files **Bug** tickets (and `drift` → Improvement), **re-tests** bugs at `In Review`, routes each filed ticket to a dev tier, and clears info-blocks for Dev. |
| **`dev-agent`** | Pulls `Todo` tickets in priority order, grooms (enough info? duplicate? done?), implements, gates on build/test, **self-reviews the diff**, ships per config, **smoke-checks prod (auto-revert on a break)**, hands off to `In Review`. Blocks rather than guesses. The default single Dev; stays active as the fallback when the two-tier split is off. |
| **`sweep-agent`** | Lifecycle janitor (slower cadence). Fixes the cracks: missing/wrong owner or **dev-tier** labels (invisible to every query → stranded), orphaned `In Progress` from crashed runs, stale signals, board-health reports. On the hub backend it also runs the optional **one-way Linear mirror** push. Hygiene only. |
| **`reflect-agent`** | Retrospective + self-evolution (daily). Studies the loop's **own** behavior and curates `lessons.md` from recurring, evidence-cited patterns. Observe + curate only; may autonomously edit only `lessons.md` — structural changes are drafted as proposals, never auto-applied. |

### Two-tier Dev — optional (opt-in per project)

Split the single Dev into a design lead and an implementer so the expensive model concentrates
on architecture and the cheaper one does the bulk coding. Enable with `DEV_SPLIT=1` on the
launcher; the legacy single `dev` stays the default, so non-split projects are unaffected.

| Agent | What it does |
|---|---|
| **`senior-dev-agent`** | **Senior tier (opus, effort max).** Two modes: **design-and-delegate** — for a new module/feature, author a living per-module **design doc**, spawn staged `Backlog` child tickets assigned to junior-dev (each carrying a `Design:` pointer), and move the design parent → `In Review` for PM to gate; and **direct-code** — when escalated a real junior verify-fail, implement → gate → ship itself. |
| **`junior-dev-agent`** | **Junior tier (sonnet, effort high).** Picks junior-routed `Todo` tickets, **reads the linked `Design:` pointer before coding**, implements against the design, runs the same gates/ship flow as dev-agent, hands off to `In Review`. Bails (info-needed) on an ambiguous spec rather than guessing. |

### Outward — observe, coordinate, direct

| Agent | What it does |
|---|---|
| **`ops-agent`** | Watches **running prod** (tight ~10–15 min cadence). Polls health checks + base URL + optional critical routes/logs and, on a **confirmed, repeated** degradation (anti-flap re-check first), files/refreshes an `incident` Bug (Urgent when prod is down). Observe-and-file — never rolls back. |
| **`architect-agent`** | Whole-codebase **tech-health auditor** (slow, daily-ish). Audits a **rotating** dimension (drift / duplication / dead code / dep-staleness + CVEs / consistency / missing abstractions), SHA-gated, and files `tech-debt` Improvements. Read-only on code — never implements. |
| **`director-agent`** | The human-facing **coordinator of DIRECTION** (hub backend; daily/on-demand). Chairs a cross-agent **discussion board** (opens topics → role-lens agents post per round → synthesizes → a **decision**) and **drafts** the roadmap the **operator publishes**; over an optional **two-way Lark/Slack channel** the operator chats with it. Coordinates + drafts — never implements/ships/verifies. No `director` config ⇒ graceful no-op (PM owns strategy). |
| **`communication-agent`** | The PR/media lead. Reads strategy, roadmap, shipped work, and public-safe product facts, then drafts one public-facing product article per cadence (daily by default). Draft-only: never publishes externally, never commits/pushes/deploys, never verifies. Can run from Codex with `DEVLOOP_ACTOR=communication`. |

### Setup — not a loop agent

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| **`/dev-loop:init`** | One-time, idempotent, operator-present setup. Runs **DETECT → MAP → ASSEMBLE → LOAD**: detect the project shape (greenfield / brownfield / adopting; single- or multi-repo), read-only-map a brownfield codebase into the PM doc-base, gather config, ensure labels + the project, scaffold the strategy doc + runtime files, optionally adopt named human tickets (per-ticket confirmation), and print a readiness checklist. Never files tickets, verifies, or ships. |

---

## The workflows

The agents are intentionally simple. The value comes from the **workflows**: agents reacting
to ticket state without a central orchestrator.

### 1. The core build loop
PM (from the strategy doc) and QA (from testing) file `Todo` tickets → Dev claims in priority
order → `In Progress` → ships → `In Review` → the **owner** verifies (PM for a Feature, QA for
a Bug). **Pass → `Done`. Fail → close + file a follow-up** (a failed increment is *superseded,
never silently reopened*, so history shows what shipped-but-failed vs what's queued).

### 2. Two-tier Dev — design-and-delegate *(opt-in)*
For a **new module or feature**, PM routes the ticket to **senior-dev**. Senior authors a
living **design doc**, decomposes it into concrete child tickets **staged in `Backlog`**
(unpickable), each carrying a `Design:` pointer, and moves the design parent → `In Review`.
**PM gates the design** (you sign off for big modules); on pass, the children **promote
`Backlog` → `Todo`** and **junior-dev** picks them, reads the design, and implements. The
expensive model designs once; the cheap model codes the pieces.

### 3. Escalation — junior → senior → human
When **junior-dev**'s work fails verification on a **real** acceptance-criteria miss (not a
flaky/infra blip — that just retries), the verifier (PM for a Feature/Improvement, QA for a
Bug) cancels it and files a **senior-dev direct-code** follow-up; senior codes it itself. If
the senior fix *also* fails → `fix-exhausted` → **`Human-Blocked`** (you). The cheap tier
tries first; the expensive tier is the safety net; you are the terminal.

### 4. Onboarding — `init` (DETECT → MAP → ASSEMBLE → LOAD)
Wire a product into the loop once: detect its shape, map a brownfield codebase into the PM
doc-base (or interview a greenfield one), provision labels/project, scaffold the strategy doc
+ runtime files, and print a readiness checklist — before you flip `mode:"live"`.

### 5. Self-evolution — report → 点评 → lesson → behavior
Every agent writes reports; Reflect distills recurring patterns into `lessons.md`; you drop a
**点评** next to any report and the agent turns your critique into a `lessons.md` rule it obeys
thereafter. The loop gets better without anyone editing skill files — and **never** rewrites
its own core instructions autonomously (those are proposed for a human).

### 6. Direction — the discussion board & roadmap *(hub backend)*
The **Director** opens a **topic**, the role-lens agents post a perspective per round, the
Director **synthesizes a decision** and **drafts** the roadmap; the **operator publishes** it.
Optionally the operator chats with the Director over a **two-way Lark/Slack channel**. Strategy
becomes a deliberated, operator-gated artifact rather than one agent's guess.

### 7. Outward monitoring — prod & codebase health
**Ops** watches running prod and files an `incident` Bug on a confirmed degradation (which
re-enters the core loop as a Bug). **Architect** audits a rotating slice of the codebase and
files `tech-debt` Improvements. **Communication** drafts the daily public product article
from verified, public-safe facts. None of them implements or publishes externally.

### 8. Human-park & notify
A genuinely human-only block (a credential, a legal sign-off, an external prerequisite) parks
the ticket — `Human-Blocked` on the hub, or `blocked`+`needs-pm` on Linear/local — and an
optional **Slack/Lark webhook** pings you out-of-band so it never sits unseen.

### 9. Mirror — hub → Linear *(hub backend)*
The hub can push its tickets one-way into Linear for human visibility (idempotent, incremental,
split-brain enforced — Linear is never read back as truth). Run the loop on the fast local hub,
watch it in Linear.

### 10. Observe — the localhost web UI *(hub backend)*
A persistent localhost daemon serves a read-only board, ticket detail, the roadmap editor,
reports, and an activity/throughput view over the same SoR — so you *watch* the loop without
touching it. The agents stay daemon-free (they coordinate through MCP, not the web UI).

---

## Use cases

**Use dev-loop when** the work repeats, "done" can be checked by a machine, and the output is
worth the tokens. In practice, that means:

- **A continuously-maintained product.** Point PM at a strategy doc and let the loop ship
  features, fix the bugs QA finds, and keep prod healthy — you review, you don't hand-code.
- **A backlog you keep falling behind on.** CI failures, dependency upgrades, a class of
  recurring bug, drift cleanup — file them (or let QA/Architect find them) and the loop
  drains the queue while you sleep.
- **A new module or large feature.** Turn on the two-tier Dev: senior-dev designs it and
  decomposes it; junior-dev builds the pieces; you gate the design and review the result.
- **Whole-codebase hardening.** Let Architect audit a rotating dimension daily and file the
  tech-debt; the loop pays it down a verified increment at a time.
- **Always-on prod watch.** Ops turns a confirmed degradation into an `incident` Bug that
  re-enters the loop — monitoring that *acts*, not just alerts.
- **Multi-repo products.** One product, many repos: tickets target a repo via a label, with
  per-repo build/branch/deploy.

**Do not use it** when "done" is mostly subjective, the task is a one-off, or the output cannot
be rejected automatically. Without real verification, a loop just produces more questionable
work at a higher rate.

> **Cost is real.** Tokens are the running cost, and *frequency* usually dominates it. A tight
> cadence across many agents on the strongest model adds up quickly. Use cheaper **models** for
> mechanical roles, choose a sane cadence, and watch the **acceptance rate** (verified ÷ filed):
> below roughly 50%, the loop is creating review work instead of saving it.

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Install the runtime CLI/hub used by MCP, Codex/opencode, and the scheduler.
npm i -g @dyzsasd/dev-loop

# 2. If you want Claude slash commands, install the plugin from a checkout.
claude --plugin-dir /path/to/dev-loop

# 3. Onboard a product. This is operator-present and idempotent.
/dev-loop:init

# 4. Dry-run first: see what it would do, with no writes.
#    Set mode:"dry-run" in projects.json, then launch one pass:
/dev-loop:pm-agent      /dev-loop:qa-agent      /dev-loop:dev-agent

# 5. Switch to mode:"live" and run the agents on a loop.
#    Use Agent View, or let dev-loop own cadence and call Claude/Codex:
cd /path/to/product-repo && dev-loop run --cli codex --agents core,communication
```

## Requirements

- **Claude Code** with this plugin installed when using slash commands / Agent View; for scheduler
  runs, the selected executor CLI (`claude`, `codex`, or opencode once verified) must be on `PATH`.
- A **coordination backend**: the **Linear MCP** (`mcp__linear-server__*`) for the default,
  or nothing extra for the local file board / hub.
- **`gh` CLI** authenticated — Dev uses it for git/deploy.
- A **git repo** for the product, and (for Linear) a **team + project** the loop may own.
- Per role: `repoPath` (Dev), `strategyDoc` (PM), `testEnv` (QA).
- For the hub backend: **Node ≥ 23.6** (built-in `node:sqlite`, zero native deps).

## Install

dev-loop now has two install surfaces:

1. **Runtime CLI / hub (recommended for every setup).** This installs `dev-loop` and
   `dev-loop-hub`, used by the service backend, MCP configs, daemon, doctor, and the
   built-in scheduler:

```bash
npm i -g @dyzsasd/dev-loop
```

After this, MCP configs can use `command:"dev-loop", args:["serve"]`; no absolute
`node /path/to/dev-loop/hub/src/server.ts` path is needed.

2. **Claude Code plugin (only for Claude slash commands).** Install this when you want
   `/dev-loop:pm-agent`, `/dev-loop:init`, Agent View, or other Claude-native plugin UX.

**Quick / dev from a source checkout (this session only):**
```bash
claude --plugin-dir /path/to/dev-loop
```

**Personal, persistent** — add a local marketplace in `~/.claude/settings.json`:
```json
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "local": { "source": { "source": "local", "path": "/path/to/parent-of-dev-loop" } }
  }
}
```
then `/plugin install dev-loop@local`. The skills appear as `/dev-loop:pm-agent`,
`/dev-loop:qa-agent`, `/dev-loop:dev-agent`, `/dev-loop:sweep-agent`,
`/dev-loop:reflect-agent`, `/dev-loop:ops-agent`, `/dev-loop:architect-agent`,
`/dev-loop:director-agent`, `/dev-loop:communication-agent`, the opt-in `/dev-loop:senior-dev-agent` +
`/dev-loop:junior-dev-agent`, and `/dev-loop:init`.

The npm package includes the agent skills and shared references needed by `dev-loop run`, so
Codex/opencode do not need a separate plugin checkout just to run scheduled agents.

## Configure

Per-project settings live in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/projects.json`
(`~/.claude/plugins/data/dev-loop/projects.json`). Seed from the example:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/plugins/data/dev-loop
cp config/projects.example.json ~/.claude/plugins/data/dev-loop/projects.json
# Then map each project to its repo, strategy doc, test env, and git/deploy flags.
```

The dials (all per-project):
- **`mode`** — `"dry-run"` (analyze + print, no writes) vs `"live"` (create/transition
  tickets and, for Dev, commit/push/deploy per `git`/`deploy`).
- **`autonomy`** — `"ask"` (escalate human-only calls) vs `"full"` (decide and act).
- **`backend`** — `"linear"` (default) / `"local"` (file board) / `"service"` (the hub). See [Backends](#backends).
- **`models`** — per-agent model at launch; **defaults to `opus`**. Tune mechanical/high-frequency
  agents down (`sonnet`/`haiku`). The two-tier Dev defaults senior=opus, junior=sonnet.
- **`repos[]`** *(optional)* — one product, many repos (else single-repo, 100% unchanged).
- **`reports.sink`** *(optional)* — `"files"` (default) vs `"linear"` (host reports + 点评 in Linear for a cloud/remote runtime).
- **`notify`** *(optional)* — Slack/Lark webhook to ping you when a ticket is human-parked.
- **`director`** *(optional, hub)* — enables the discussion board + roadmap + two-way channel.
- **`communication`** *(optional)* — enables daily article drafts; output is draft-only, either in the data dir or a repo docs directory.

## Set up a project

**Run `/dev-loop:init` once** (above) — it scaffolds everything and prints a readiness
checklist before you go live. It creates only what's missing and overwrites nothing. As a
backstop, the loop agents also re-apply the label/project checks on the first `live` run.

## Run the loop

Pick the launch style that fits your setup:

- **Agent View** (native) — `claude agents`, then dispatch each as a self-looping session:
  `/loop 5m /dev-loop:pm-agent`, `/loop 5m /dev-loop:qa-agent`, `/loop 5m /dev-loop:dev-agent`,
  `/loop 30m /dev-loop:sweep-agent`, `/loop 24h /dev-loop:reflect-agent`, plus the opt-in
  outward agents (`ops`, `architect`, `director`, `communication`).
- **Built-in scheduler** — from inside a configured repo, run `dev-loop run --cli claude`
  or `dev-loop run --cli codex --agents core,communication`. dev-loop owns the cadence;
  Claude/Codex only execute one agent fire at a time. Use `--project <key>` only when
  launching from outside the repo or overriding cwd detection.
- **A local tmux launcher** — one pane per agent, per-agent models in one command. Set
  `DEV_SPLIT=1` to run the two-tier Dev (senior-dev + junior-dev panes) instead of one `dev`.
- **Manually** — one turn at a time, for a single pass.

**Cadence** (they self-throttle, so idle fires are cheap no-ops): PM/QA/Dev ~5 min, Sweep
~30 min, Reflect daily; Ops ~10 min, Architect/Director/Communication daily/on-demand.

**Resume is ordinary** because agents are stateless per run. After a stop, crash, or reboot,
launch them again; each agent re-reads ground truth and continues.

> ⚠️ **`mode:"live"` + `autonomy:"full"` + `autoPush`/`autoDeploy` = unattended commits,
> pushes, and prod deploys with no human gate.** That is the intended power, but try
> `mode:"dry-run"` (or `dev-loop run --once --dry-run`) first to see what it would do.

## Backends

Coordination is pluggable; the agents and protocols are identical across all three.

| Backend | What it is | Gives you |
|---|---|---|
| **`linear`** *(default)* | Coordinate through the Linear MCP | Cloud, team-visible, the Linear app as UI |
| **`local`** | A machine-local markdown file board in the data dir | Zero-cloud, minimal, no Linear required |
| **`service`** | A local **hub** — an MCP system-of-record over `node:sqlite` | **Real per-agent identity**, a localhost **web UI**, versioned operator-published docs, the discussion board + Director, the two-way channel, the one-way Linear mirror, CLI-portability |

The **work plane** (states, transitions, responsibilities, and the agent loop) is identical
across backends. The **surface plane** (per-agent identity, web UI, board/Director) expands by
backend. See [conventions §18](references/conventions.md) +
[`docs/HUB-ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/HUB-ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Safety boundary

The agents operate **only** on tickets carrying the **`dev-loop`** label, scoped to the
configured project. They never read, transition, or comment on any other ticket. This single
label is the firewall between the loop and your human backlog; treat it as part of the safety
model.

## Self-evolution

`reflect-agent` is what lets the loop improve without drifting into chaos:
- It reads the loop's **own** output and distills **recurring** patterns (≥2 occurrences,
  each citing ticket IDs / commit SHAs) into `lessons.md` — the per-operator override every
  agent reads at the top of every run.
- **The hard boundary** ([conventions §17](references/conventions.md)): Reflect may edit
  `lessons.md` autonomously (local, reversible, never committed) but **must not** auto-rewrite
  the SKILLs or `conventions.md`. Structural changes are **drafted as proposals** for the
  operator to apply by git commit. Self-modification of the core is *surfaced, not executed* —
  the one principled exception to "decide and act".

## Reports & operator review (点评)

You steer the loop by reviewing its trail, not by editing code inside the loop.
- **Reports.** Each agent writes a daily log rolled up weekly/monthly under
  `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/<project-key>/reports/<agent>/` — machine-local, never committed,
  secret/PII-safe. A no-op fire writes nothing.
- **点评.** Drop a sibling `<report>.review.md` with free-form prose; at its next run the
  agent distills your critique into one `lessons.md` rule under its own section and obeys it
  thereafter. The whole loop: **report → your 点评 → lesson → changed behavior.**
- **Cloud/remote?** Set `reports.sink:"linear"` and reports become per-agent Linear documents
  with the 点评 as a comment — read and critique from a browser/phone (same firewall, §16
  guardrails).

## Codex integration (optional)

The loop can use **OpenAI Codex** as a power tool via the
[codex-plugin-cc](https://github.com/openai/codex-plugin-cc) companion + the `codex` CLI.
**Opt-in; absent means unchanged.** It adds, each independently gated, an **independent
second-model review** (Dev Step 5.5 + Architect; advisory, never touches the board),
**image generation** (PM mockups + Dev production assets — the one thing the loop can't do
itself), and a one-shot **rescue** before a `fix-exhausted` block. See
[conventions §24](references/conventions.md) + [`references/codex-integration.md`](references/codex-integration.md).

Separately, the `service` hub can run the agents themselves from Codex; see
[`docs/PORTABILITY.md`](docs/PORTABILITY.md). The Communication pane uses
`DEVLOOP_ACTOR=communication` with `/dev-loop:communication-agent`.

## Deep docs

- [`references/conventions.md`](references/conventions.md) — the authoritative spec (state machine, labels, every protocol). Every agent reads it first.
- [`references/config-schema.md`](references/config-schema.md) — the full `projects.json` field reference.
- [`docs/RUNNING.md`](docs/RUNNING.md) — onboarding, launch methods, models, resume.
- [`docs/HUB-ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/HUB-ARCHITECTURE.md) — the local hub / `service` backend.
- [`docs/DAEMON.md`](docs/DAEMON.md) — the localhost web UI + daemon.
- [`docs/PORTABILITY.md`](docs/PORTABILITY.md) — running the loop on a second CLI (Codex / opencode).
- [`docs/design/`](docs/design/) — the design records (backend choice, daemon repositioning, the two-tier Dev split).
- [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) — full version history.

## Status

**v0.22.1.** Eleven launchable agents — five inward (**PM / QA / Dev / Sweep / Reflect**),
four outward (**Ops / Architect / Director / Communication**), and an opt-in two-tier
**senior-dev / junior-dev** Dev split — plus the `init` onboarding command.
Coordination is backend-pluggable: **Linear** (default), a **local file board**, or the
**local hub** (`node:sqlite` SoR with per-agent identity + a localhost web UI + versioned
docs + the discussion board/Director + a two-way Lark/Slack channel + a one-way Linear
mirror + CLI-portability). Recent: the **two-tier Dev** (senior designs / junior implements,
opt-in, back-compat); **standalone npm packaging** (`npm i -g @dyzsasd/dev-loop`) with bundled
agent skills for scheduler runs and a Codex-certified multi-CLI path; and **loop-cost governance** (a runaway/no-progress circuit-breaker, an
acceptance-rate metric). Validated end-to-end and battle-tested across long live runs;
autonomy (push/deploy) is opt-in per project and gated on a green build. Full history in
[`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md).
