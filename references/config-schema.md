# dev-loop — Config schema

The dev-loop agents (PM / QA / Dev / Sweep / Reflect) read
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/projects.json`. It maps each product to its Linear project, its
repo, its test environment, and its ship/deploy settings. One file, many products.
`/dev-loop:init` gathers and writes this file with you (operator-present setup).

## Schema

```jsonc

  "defaultProject": "monpick",        // used when the user doesn't name one and >1 exist
  "projects": {
    "<key>": {                        // short slug you'll refer to (e.g. "monpick", "geo")

## Notes
- **Required per project**: `linearTeam`, `linearProject`. `repoPath` is required
  for Dev; `strategyDoc` for PM; `testEnv` for QA. A skill prompts for any
  required field it's missing rather than guessing.
- **`testEnv.setup`** (optional): a one-time command to bootstrap the test harness
  (install the browser driver, create a venv, etc.). QA runs it when the tooling
  named in `testCommand` is missing, so a fresh machine or a scheduled run isn't
  blocked by an absent harness. Keep it idempotent.
- **Two orthogonal kinds of autonomy** (conventions §12a):
  - *How code lands* — the `git` + `deploy` flags. Fully hands-off shipping is
    `autoCommit/autoPush/autoDeploy: true` with a `deploy.command`; to put a human
    in the loop on landing, set `autoPush`/`autoDeploy: false`.
  - *How much the agents decide vs escalate* — the top-level `autonomy` field.
    `"ask"` (default) keeps the conservative posture (escalate genuinely human-only
    calls to the user, surface open product-direction decisions). `"full"` grants
    standing authority to **decide and act, not ask**: resolve scoping/product-
    direction calls from the `strategyDoc`, do irreversible prod ops attended
    (pre/post-verify + records-only form), and stop only for genuine **external
    prerequisites** (real credentials, money, legal) — never an interactive prompt.
    Caution stays the method, not a reason to defer.
- **Safety**: there is no MonPick Linear project yet. Either create a dedicated
  project (recommended) or point `linearProject` at one you own. The `dev-loop`
  label (conventions §2) is what actually protects the human backlog, but a
  dedicated project keeps the board clean.
- Secrets (passwords, tokens) are **not** stored here — reference how to obtain
  them (`.env.local`, a vault, "ask user") in `testEnv.notes`. See the security
  doctrine (conventions §16).
- **`lessons.md`** (optional) lives next to `projects.json` and holds per-operator
  behavioral corrections, sectioned per agent (`Shared`/`PM`/`QA`/`Dev`/`Sweep`/
  `Reflect`). Each skill reads it at run-start and applies its section that fire
  (conventions §14). Local machine state — never committed. The **Reflect** agent (the
  daily retrospective role) is the one agent that *writes* this file — it curates it
  from recurring, evidence-cited patterns it observes across runs (conventions §17).
  Reflect may edit only `lessons.md` autonomously (reversible, per-operator); it must
  NOT auto-edit the SKILLs or `conventions.md` — those changes are drafted as proposals
  for the human. Reflect bounds its window from Linear + git (always present) and the
  `*-state.json` files; if a launcher happens to tee agent output to
  `logs/<agent>-<date>.log` in the data dir, it reads that too, but degrades silently
  when absent. It writes no new config keys.
- **`backend`** (optional; default `"linear"`): the coordination substrate
  (conventions §18). `"linear"` is the Linear MCP, exactly as today — absent ⇒
  `"linear"`, so existing projects are unchanged. `"local"` uses a machine-local file
  board under `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/<key>/board/` (one markdown file per ticket; state
  in the frontmatter; same state machine, labels, and protocols). `localBoard`
  overrides the board path; `ticketPrefix` sets the ID prefix (default `"DL"`). Both
  are ignored under `"linear"`. In `"local"` mode `strategyDoc` must be a **repo file**
  (a Linear document can't back a local board), and `/dev-loop:init` scaffolds `board/`
  while skipping the Linear label/project steps.
- **`deploy.healthCheck`** (optional): a URL (must return 2xx) or a command (must
  exit 0) that Dev runs in Step 6.5 right after an unattended prod deploy. On a
  repeated failure Dev rolls the deploy back (revert + redeploy) rather than leaving
  prod broken. Absent → Dev smoke-checks `testEnv.baseUrl` root for a non-5xx.
- **Agent state files** (`pm-state.json`, `qa-state.json`) live next to
  `projects.json` and hold per-project loop state: last-reviewed/swept SHA, swept
  review lenses (PM), swept surfaces (QA). Local per-operator runtime state — never
  committed, never shared. Created lazily on first run, or up-front by `/dev-loop:init`
  (which also seeds the `lessons.md` skeleton next to this file and gathers/writes back
  the per-project fields above WITH the operator — operator-present setup, so asking
  for unknowable values like `repoPath`/`linearProject`/`deploy.command` is expected
  there, unlike the unattended loop agents). Creates only what's missing.
