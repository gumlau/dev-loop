# Changelog

All notable changes to the dev-loop plugin. Most of these landed from **live-loop
experience** — a real failure observed while the agents ran, then hardened into a rule.

## 0.24.0 — External headless scheduler is the one canonical way to run the loop
- **One canonical model, three deployment options.** The loop runs as **external, headless, one-shot
  fires** — never an in-session `/loop` cadence (which accumulates conversation context and burns
  tokens). Choose: **(1) an OS scheduler** (recommended), **(2) the `dev-loop run` persistent
  supervisor** (for hosts without an OS scheduler), or **(3) a manual interactive one-shot** for
  debugging. Each fire is a fresh stateless `claude -p` / `codex exec`. **Measured:** a live
  `claude -p` benchmark (`hub/bench/loop-vs-oneshot-tokens.sh`, see
  `docs/benchmarks/scheduler-vs-loop-tokens.md`) shows per-fire context held flat at ~73k tokens
  under the one-shot scheduler vs. monotonic unbounded growth (~1.2k+ tokens/fire, a floor) under an
  in-session `/loop`.
- **NEW `dev-loop service` OS-scheduler layer.** `dev-loop service install|uninstall|status|list`
  generates and installs per-platform scheduler units — **launchd** (macOS), **systemd** (Linux),
  **cron** (fallback) — that each fire `dev-loop run --once --agents <agent> --project <key> --cli
  <claude|codex>` on its cadence (PM/QA/Dev 5m, Ops 10m, Sweep 30m, Reflect/Architect/Communication
  daily), plus a **KeepAlive daemon unit** that holds the hub web-UI daemon + circuit-breakers up
  headlessly. Flags: `--cli`, `--agents`, `--project`, `--launchd|--systemd|--cron`, `--dry-run`,
  `--no-daemon`. Idempotent and per-project; `uninstall` removes exactly what it installed. The
  installer bakes **absolute paths** into each unit (OS schedulers don't inherit your shell PATH);
  systemd headless needs `loginctl enable-linger`.
- **One-shot hardening.** A per-`(project,agent)` **overlap lock** so a slow fire can't double-run
  when the next cadence tick arrives; an MCP-child PATH fix using `process.execPath` so spawned hub
  subprocesses resolve the right Node/binary under a bare scheduler env; and an opt-in
  `--max-fires-per-day` daily cap alongside the existing `--max-fires`.
- **Retired from the docs:** the in-session `/loop` cadence as a recommended run mode, the Claude
  Agent View `/loop` rows, and the `run-loop.sh` tmux launcher. The READMEs, `docs/RUNNING.md`, and
  the design/reference docs now present the single canonical model.
- **BACK-COMPAT — explicitly unchanged:** the Claude **plugin**, every `/dev-loop:*` slash command,
  `/dev-loop:init`, the `SessionStart` web-UI hook, the `/loop` mechanics themselves (still work
  mechanically for a manual one-shot), the **stateless agent core**, the **hub** + its state machine,
  and **second-CLI portability** (Codex / opencode). Nothing in the runtime contract changed — this
  release reframes *how you deploy the loop*, not what an agent does per fire.

## 0.23.0 — Turnkey scheduler MCP for both CLIs + Director removal
- **Scheduler self-injects the hub MCP for both CLIs**, so `dev-loop run` (Mode B) needs **no plugin
  and no `.mcp.json`**: `--cli claude` passes an inline `--mcp-config '{…}' --strict-mcp-config`, and
  `--cli codex` *defines* the `dev-loop-hub` server from scratch via `-c mcp_servers.dev-loop-hub.*`
  overrides (command/args/env). Verified end-to-end on a fresh npm install — `whoami` returns the
  injected `DEVLOOP_ACTOR` for both.
- **Codex `--codex-safe` caveat documented:** unattended Codex loops must run in the **default** mode.
  `--codex-safe` drops `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`, and `codex exec` then auto-cancels
  every MCP tool call (`dev-loop-hub/whoami (failed)` → `user cancelled`), starving the agent of the
  hub. Use `--codex-safe` only for attended runs.
- **`install-claude-plugin` now registers a local npm-source marketplace** (writes a
  `marketplace.json` pointing at the `@dyzsasd/dev-loop` npm package and prints the `/plugin
  marketplace add` + `/plugin install dev-loop@dev-loop-npm` commands) instead of copying the plugin
  tree into `~/.claude/skills` — no GitHub, no file-copy drift.
- **Adds `--max-fires N`** to `dev-loop run` (default: unlimited) to bound a continuous run.
- **Removed `install-codex-prompts`** (the `~/.codex/prompts/*.md` compatibility layer): Codex
  deprecated custom prompts in favor of skills, and `dev-loop run --cli codex` is the durable path.
- **Removed the Director agent + discussion board**; direction is routed through PM. The strategy/
  roadmap north-star drives tickets directly.
- The npm build ships the Claude plugin manifest, hooks, skills, references, and config templates so
  the scheduler runs from the published package; docs now present the two run modes (plugin / `dev-loop
  run`) and the three-layer architecture (interface · hub · agents).

## 0.22.1 — Communication agent + Codex-startable scheduler
Adds `communication-agent`, an outward PR/media role that drafts one public-facing product
article per cadence (daily by default) from strategy, roadmap, shipped work, and public-safe
product facts. It is draft-only: no external publishing, no commits/pushes/deploys, and no ticket
verification.
- Hub identity now seeds the active `communication` actor, so a Codex pane can launch the agent with
  `DEVLOOP_ACTOR=communication` under the same service-hub portability contract as the other agents.
- Adds `dev-loop run`, a built-in scheduler that owns cadence itself and shells out to `claude -p`
  or `codex exec` once per due agent fire. This gives the loop an unattended mode that does not
  depend on Claude/Codex `/loop`; Codex actor/project/db identity is injected with `-c` overrides.
- Simplifies npm/MCP installation: the published package now bundles the agent skills, shared
  references, and config templates used by `dev-loop run`; MCP templates and `init-service` now
  default to `dev-loop serve` instead of an absolute `hub/src/server.ts` checkout path.
- `projects.example.json`, `config-schema.md`, `RUNNING.md`, `PORTABILITY.md`, all README languages,
  conventions, and plugin marketplace copy now document Communication and its Codex launch path.

## 0.22.0 — two-tier Dev: senior-dev (design lead) + junior-dev (implementer)
Splits the single `dev` agent into an optional two-tier model (conventions §21a; `DEV_SPLIT=1` in the
launcher) — **additive + back-compat: `dev` + `skills/dev-agent` stay active**, so single-dev projects
(e.g. monpick on Linear) are byte-for-byte unchanged. Designed collaboratively with the operator, built
via a workflow (keystone → parallel implement → 2 adversarial critics), critic findings folded.
- **senior-dev** (`claude-opus-4-8`, effort max) — the design lead. Two modes: *design-and-delegate*
  (author a living per-module **design** doc, spawn `junior-dev` child tickets staged in `Backlog` with
  a `Design:` pointer, move the design parent to In-Review for PM to gate) and *direct-code* (escalation
  tickets it codes itself).
- **junior-dev** (`claude-sonnet-4-6`, effort high) — the implementer. Picks its own `Todo` slice, reads
  the linked design first, ships to In-Review. Cheaper bulk coding on sonnet; opus reserved for design +
  escalation (also eases the spend rate).
- **PM routing**: new module/feature → senior-dev; improvement/bug-fix → junior-dev; borderline → junior
  (escalation is the safety net). **Design gate**: PM verifies the design parent → Done → child tickets
  promote `Backlog`→`Todo`. **Escalation**: a junior **real** acceptance-criteria fail (not a flake) →
  the verifier (PM for its Feature, QA for its Bug) Cancels + files a `senior-dev` direct-code follow-up;
  senior re-fail → `fix-exhausted` → `Human-Blocked`.
- **New doc tier `design`** owned by senior-dev: a hub `design` doc-kind (service; additive `user_version`
  v3 migration — lossless `documents` rebuild, multi-instance per module, not publish-gated) / a
  `docs/design/<slug>.md` file (repo). A PRODUCT doc senior authors autonomously (not a §17 governing
  file). Per-backend routing: assignee actor (service) / `senior-dev`/`junior-dev` label (linear/local).

## 0.21.0 — standalone daemon + multi-CLI: turnkey on-ramp, npm package, Codex certified
The **standalone-daemon + single-host multi-CLI repositioning** (design `docs/design/daemon-multicli-repositioning.md`),
shipped as an additive P1–P5 arc — the loop ran throughout, every prior path (stdio MCP, read-only daemon,
`linear`/`local`/`service` backends, the Claude plugin) unchanged byte-for-byte.
- **P1 — Turnkey on-ramp.** Idempotent per-project daemon lifecycle `daemon up|down|status` (DL-41,
  deterministic per-project port, real `/api/health` liveness, no double-start); a plugin **`SessionStart`
  hook** auto-starts the web UI each session (DL-42, operator-applied §17); the dormant agent **op-API**
  `POST /api/op/*` gated on `hub.transport:"daemon"` (DL-43, default-off).
- **P2 — Thin stdio shim → 100% `server.ts` drop-in.** `shim.ts` proxies tool calls to the loopback daemon
  op-API (identity via env→`X-Devloop-Actor`, dodging the `claude -p` header-drop); shipped family-by-family
  to all 29 tools (DL-55/62/64/67/68).
- **P3 — Dispatch convergence + single writer.** `server.ts`'s MCP handlers converge onto the shared
  `agentops` ops (DL-69, one definition per policy, differential-parity proven); the daemon's one long-lived
  writable connection gets a periodic `wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)` (DL-70).
- **P4 — Standalone npm package.** `npm i -g @dyzsasd/dev-loop`: a `dev-loop` CLI (serve/shim/daemon/
  init-service/mcp-merge/seed/doctor/identity-check/run) + bins, a publish build (node won't type-strip
  under `node_modules` → ships compiled `dist/`, in-repo dev stays zero-build), bundled skills/references
  for scheduler runs without a source checkout, and a **single-version stamp** across
  `package.json`+`plugin.json`+`marketplace.json` with a guard test (DL-71).
- **P5 — Codex certified.** End-to-end on `codex-cli 0.142.0`: MCP transport + data tools round-trip; per-pane
  identity rides a **`-c` override** (Codex doesn't propagate the launching process env) — `docs/PORTABILITY.md` §4a (DL-72).
- **Operator-alert + backend choice.** One operator-alert channel `{transport: webhook|bot}` — the simple
  webhook now fires on the canonical `Human-Blocked` state (DL-52/59); `init` gained a first-class "choose your
  ticket system" step + service auto-wiring, and §18 a Backend-parity spec (work-plane identical / surface-plane
  superset / deferred backend-switch seam) (DL-50/53/56/60/61). `Phase B` (remote/multi-user auth) named, deferred.

## 0.20.0 — hub daemon + web UI + roadmap bridge + cwd project auto-pin (self-hosted milestone)
Shipped by the dev-loop loop **dogfooding itself on the hub** (`backend:"service"`, project `dev-loop`,
per-agent attribution) — 22 tickets, all Done, all built/tested by the autonomous loop and §17-firewalled
(the one conventions/SKILL change, DL-12, was operator-applied).
- **Daemon + read-only web UI** (DL-1/DL-2) — `npm run daemon` (`hub/src/daemon.ts`): a **127.0.0.1-only**
  HTTP read surface over the hub SoR (zero native deps, no build step), port `8787` (override
  `DEVLOOP_DAEMON_PORT`). Serves the board, ticket+comments, docs, daily reports (DL-10), and an
  activity/throughput view over the events ledger (DL-17), with server-side board filter/search (DL-20)
  and markdown rendering (DL-16).
- **Roadmap view/edit + Lark/Slack bridge** (DL-3/DL-4) — the web UI can VIEW and EDIT the kind:"roadmap"
  doc; a Lark/Slack bridge to view + propose roadmap edits. Write routes carry an **Origin/Host guard**
  (CSRF + DNS-rebinding defense, DL-19); the editor preserves typed text on a rejected save (DL-14).
- **cwd→project auto-pin** (DL-12 operator-applied §17 wording + DL-13 code + DL-15 launcher/docs) —
  launch an agent from inside a project's repo and the hub + SKILLs **auto-select that project**;
  `DEVLOOP_PROJECT` is now **optional** (§11 ladder gains a cwd rung + the restored `defaultProject`
  rung; §18/§26 updated). Certified by `hub/test/resolve-project.ts`.
- **Self-hardening** — bug fixes: empty-string assignee (DL-6), path percent-escape 500→400 (DL-7),
  doc.save cross-kind identity (DL-9), DRYRUN mirror.push write (DL-11), a flaky loop test (DL-21),
  create_issue_label silent-success (DL-22). RUNNING.md surfaces the daemon/web UI (DL-18).
- 10 hub test suites green (smoke/loop/isolation/docs/board/channel/mirror/identity/resolve-project/daemon).
  plugin + marketplace → 0.20.0; hub → 0.7.0.

## 0.19.2 — self-hosting hygiene + cache-refresh bump
- **`.gitignore` now excludes `.mcp.json`** — a self-hosting / service-backend setup (or `/dev-loop:init`)
  writes a machine-local `.mcp.json` (abs paths, per-pane `${DEVLOOP_ACTOR}`); the committed template
  stays `config/mcp.example.json`. This keeps a generated `.mcp.json` from being accidentally committed
  by the loop. No code/SKILL change.
- Version bump (plugin + marketplace → 0.19.2) to force a `/plugin update` cache refresh, so a fresh
  session re-initializing a project via `/dev-loop:init` loads the full P5–P8 + 0.19.1 plugin (not a
  stale cached copy — the marketplace-version-sync discipline).

## 0.19.1 — hardening from the Codex adversarial review (P4–P8)
After the P0→P8 build, a cross-model adversarial review (OpenAI gpt-5.5 via the `codex` CLI; full
report in `docs/reviews/codex-2026-06-P4-P8.md`) ran `npm test` (passed) and audited the hub. No
CRITICAL; verdict "fix-first". The real findings, fixed:
- **P6 `channel.poll` could SKIP messages (HIGH).** A single 50-item page advanced the cursor to the
  page max past unfetched older messages. `pollVia` now **pages** through Slack `has_more`/`next_cursor`
  + Lark `has_more`/`page_token` until drained, with a runaway guard that THROWS (cursor unadvanced)
  rather than skip; `normalize()`'s strictly-after-cursor filter + the UNIQUE dedup make over-fetch
  harmless. (test: a 2-page Slack fixture is fully collected.)
- **P7 mirror crash-recovery could leave Linear stale (HIGH).** A crashed-create retry that reconciled
  an existing issue by the `[hub:id]` marker wrote the new hash WITHOUT updating Linear. `mirror.push`
  now **always reconciles before create** AND `updateIssue`s a reconciled issue to current content
  before advancing the hash — also narrowing the concurrent-create-duplicate window (full safety still
  assumes the single-Sweep-per-project model; documented).
- **`save_issue` update was a read-then-write race (HIGH).** The append-only `relatedTo` merge could
  lose a concurrent link. The update (read-cur → merge → write) is now one `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` txn.
- **§16 ref validation (MEDIUM).** `channel.register` / `mirror.push` now reject a value passed where
  an ENV-VAR NAME belongs (env-name shape + token-prefix denylist) — a secret can't be persisted to
  the DB. (test: `channel.register` rejects a literal `xoxb-…`.)
- **`channel.poll` insert (MEDIUM).** `INSERT OR IGNORE` → `ON CONFLICT(channel_id,direction,
  provider_msg_id) DO NOTHING` so only the dedup conflict is suppressed; any other insert failure
  rolls back without advancing the cursor.
- **`doc.publish` single-current invariant (MEDIUM).** Publishing vN after vM left two version rows
  `status='current'`; publish now resets all to draft then marks the chosen one, in a txn. (test added.)
- **`identity-check --expect <actor>` (MEDIUM).** The gate now catches a WRONG-but-valid actor
  (mis-attribution), not just unknown/unset; `--expect` (or `DEVLOOP_EXPECT_ACTOR`) fails on mismatch.
  (test added; PORTABILITY.md + §26 updated.)
- **Provider error scrub (MEDIUM) + `topic.synthesize` clean CONFLICT (LOW).** Persisted/returned
  provider errors are run through a token-shaped redactor; a repeat same-round synthesize returns a
  structured CONFLICT instead of a raw UNIQUE error.
Accepted-as-is: the `whoami`/`identity-check` db-path field (operator's own machine; diagnostic). hub
→ 0.6.2; plugin + marketplace → 0.19.1.

## 0.19.0 — hub P8: second-CLI portability (Codex / opencode)
- **The loop is no longer Claude-Code-only.** Because the hub is a plain stdio MCP server with
  env-based identity and no daemon, the same agents + hub + per-agent identity run on a second coding
  CLI (Codex, opencode, …) against the *same* `hub.db`. **Claude Code is 100% unchanged** — P8 is
  purely additive + opt-in.
- **One CLI-agnostic env contract** (any launcher sets it per pane): `DEVLOOP_ACTOR` /
  `DEVLOOP_PROJECT` / `DEVLOOP_HUB_DB` + the SKILLs' config-resolution vars `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` /
  `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA` (just env-var names — any CLI's launcher exports them, so the SKILL bodies need
  **zero edits**; a thin wrapper substitutes the `${...}` placeholders into the SKILL body before
  feeding it as the prompt, since a second CLI has no plugin loader).
- **The identity gate** (the §5 onboarding test — per-agent identity is the headline win AND a safety
  control): a CLI is onboarded only after it PASSES — set `DEVLOOP_ACTOR=dev`, ask it to call the
  hub's `whoami` through its headless MCP spawn, expect actor `dev`; `operator`/anything-else ⇒ FAIL
  (the CLI isn't propagating per-pane identity → **do not onboard**, fail closed). New
  `dev-loop-hub identity-check` CLI mode is the launcher-side sanity check (prints the resolved
  actor/project/db + `wouldStart`; exit 1 if the actor would be refused). `hub/test/identity.ts`
  certifies the contract (env→resolution, fail-closed on unknown actor, the `operator`-default
  mis-attribution signal, no secret in output).
- **Docs + config:** `docs/PORTABILITY.md` (the env contract, per-CLI MCP registration + headless
  wrapper + the identity gate + what stays the same), `config/mcp.codex.toml.example` +
  `config/mcp.opencode.json.example` (best-effort, **⚠️ marked operator-verify** — formats/env-
  propagation must be confirmed against the installed CLI, never invented), conventions §26,
  RUNNING.md cross-ref.
- **CLI-independent invariants confirmed:** §17 firewall (prompt-gated + git-backed), §16 secrets
  (env, server-side), cooperative-not-anti-spoof identity, no daemon — all hold on every CLI. The
  Director sync-panel already has an internal-deliberation fallback for a CLI lacking a Task tool
  (§25). plugin + marketplace → 0.19.0; hub → 0.6.1.
- *Designed inline* (the design workflow hit sustained server 529s); Codex/opencode specifics are
  flagged operator-verify rather than asserted — the final Codex review is the independent cross-check.

## 0.18.0 — hub P7: the one-way Linear mirror (human visibility)
- **Linear demoted to a push-only mirror.** The hub is the source of truth; an opt-in `mirror`
  config (under `backend:"service"`) projects the hub's tickets OUT to Linear so humans who live
  in Linear can SEE the loop — without Linear becoming a second SoR. Absent ⇒ no mirror (today's
  behavior); a `mirror` under `backend:"linear"`/`"local"` is a config error (no hub to mirror).
- **Strictly one-way + split-brain enforced.** The hub WRITES Linear and reads ONLY to reconcile
  its own id mapping — it NEVER imports Linear state as truth. Every mirrored issue carries a
  banner ("🤖 Mirrored from the dev-loop hub — edits here are IGNORED and overwritten; give
  direction via the Director"), re-applied each push. The content hash is HUB-derived, so a human
  edit on Linear is overwritten on the next push (hub state always wins). A hub Canceled/Duplicate
  mirrors as a state change, **never** a hard-delete (no data loss). There is **no** mirror.pull /
  import / sync-from-Linear tool — only `mirror.push` / `mirror.status`.
- **Idempotent, incremental, crash-safe.** `mirror_map` (hub id → Linear id + content hash) skips
  an unchanged ticket (incremental — a fire is cheap when nothing changed). The map row is written
  **before** the remote create (linear_id NULL = create pending), and a NULL-id retry **reconciles
  by the `[hub:id]` title marker** before creating — so a crash between issueCreate and recording
  the mapping never orphans or double-creates. A failed push leaves the row un-advanced and retries
  next fire (never throws the token).
- **§16 secret discipline (inherited from P6).** The Linear API key lives ONLY in env (`tokenEnv`
  is the NAME); the hub reads it server-side, calls the Linear GraphQL API, and never returns/logs/
  persists it — a failure surfaces only an HTTP status / truncated Linear error. Every call has a
  hard ~10s timeout. State mapping is a config `stateMap` (hub State → workspace-specific Linear
  state id) with a no-fail fallback (a missing state ⇒ no stateId; state stays in the body).
- **Daemon-free.** **Sweep Job 5** runs the push on its slow cadence (hygiene-adjacent: "reflect
  the hub outward"); it's an ordinary outbound HTTPS call (the P6 pattern), gated on
  `backend:"service"` + a `mirror` config, fail-closed, never blocks the fire.
- `hub/src/linear.ts` (GraphQL adapter — createIssue/updateIssue/findByMarker, injectable
  `fetchImpl`, hard timeout); `hub/test/mirror.ts` certifies it (adapter units with mock fetch —
  create/update/find/error/timeout, token-never-thrown — + DRYRUN tool tests: create-then-update
  idempotency, incremental hash-skip, banner + marker in the body, stateMap fallback, cancel-not-
  deleted, secret-never-returned, one-way no-pull-tool, isolation). conventions §18 + config-schema
  + Sweep extended; hub → 0.6.0.

## 0.17.0 — hub P6: the provider-agnostic two-way IM channel
- **The operator can now CHAT with the Director over Lark/Slack** (opt-in, a `director.channel`
  block under `backend:"service"`; absent ⇒ today's behavior — the Director chairs the board
  with no chat I/O). The two-way superset of the one-way §9 `notify`: inbound operator direction
  + outbound digests / replies / blocked-notifies.
- **Poll-based — NO daemon (consistent with P5).** A loopback stdio process owns no inbound
  endpoint, so the Director **reaches out** each fire: `channel.poll()` does an outbound history
  read since the **hub-stored cursor** (`channels.inbound_cursor` — the same no-state-file move
  as P5's `round_opened_at`), ingests new operator messages, returns the pending inbox.
  `channel.send()` pushes structured messages. Poll latency = the fire cadence (a
  direction/status/digest plane, not real-time chat); an on-demand `/director-agent` fire is the
  fast-turn escape. **Two-phase poll:** the provider fetch holds NO db lock; only the
  dedup-insert + cursor-advance is in `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`, and the cursor advances only to the
  `max(provider_ts)` actually recorded (no skipped message).
- **Tools** (`channel.register/send/poll/ack/status`): register stores only env-var NAMES + a
  room id; send BUILDS a §16 allow-listed message server-side (structured fields only — notify:
  ticket id + bail-shape; digest: counts + bounded ids; reply/headline: bounded + control-char
  stripped); poll ingests + dedups (`UNIQUE(channel_id,'inbound',provider_msg_id)`) + GCs acted
  inbox rows >14d; ack records provenance (`acted_into`); status returns env-var-SET booleans,
  never the secret.
- **§16 secret discipline.** The token/URL/secret lives ONLY in env (`tokenEnv`/`secretEnv` are
  NAMES); the hub reads it server-side, posts/polls, and never returns/logs/persists it — a
  failed call surfaces only an HTTP status / provider error CODE. Every network call has a hard
  ~10s timeout (a hung provider never wedges a fire). A per-process send cap is a loop-safety
  throttle. Slack = `xoxb-` Bearer; Lark = an internal app's `app_id`+`app_secret` → an
  in-memory-only `tenant_access_token`. Two-way needs a **history-read** scope — a real
  credential escalation over `notify`'s write-only webhook (documented).
- **Inbound is DATA, not a command channel (instruction-source boundary).** An operator chat
  message is direction the Director acts on within its existing authority; a chat instruction to
  bypass a gate ("publish the roadmap", "edit conventions", "forward secrets") is **refused +
  surfaced**, never executed. The bot's own messages are filtered on read (no self-echo loop).
- **`notify` COEXISTS** (not replaced): the minimal one-way PM ping on any backend; `channel` is
  the Director's two-way superset on `service`. `hub/src/channel.ts` (Slack + Lark adapters,
  injectable `fetchImpl`); `hub/test/channel.ts` certifies it (adapter units with mock fetch —
  send/poll/timeout/parse/token-never-thrown — + DRYRUN tool tests: allow-list build, payload
  shape, cursor advance + dedup, secret-never-returned, ack, isolation). conventions §25 + §9
  extended; hub → 0.5.0.

## 0.16.0 — hub P5: the discussion board + the Director
- **A second coordination plane (opt-in, `backend:"service"` + a `director` config; absent ⇒
  byte-for-byte today's behavior).** The agents coordinate through ticket state but never
  deliberate directly; P5 adds a hub-native **discussion board** where the **Director** poses a
  question and the role-lens agents (PM/QA/Dev/Architect) answer, and the Director synthesizes a
  **decision** and folds it into the roadmap. Board + roadmap are hub tables/docs — per-project
  isolated, attributable to `DEVLOOP_ACTOR`, §17-firewalled (DB-only; a decision is **data**,
  never an action).
- **Board tools** (`topic.open/list/get`, `post.add`, `topic.synthesize`, `topic.close`):
  - `topic.open` makes the caller the **chair** (`opened_by`); invited handles are validated.
  - `post.add` is **invited-only, your-lane, once-per-round, append-only** — wrapped in
    `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` so the round-read + insert is atomic against a concurrent round-bump.
  - `synthesize`/`close` are **chair-gated** (`ACTOR === opened_by`); `synthesize` writes a
    synthesis post + optionally bumps the round, `close` records the terminal **decision**.
    `topic.list` returns each open topic's `round`, `round_opened_at`, `pending` invitees, and
    your `youArePending` in one cheap call.
- **A topic ALWAYS terminates** — `director.maxRounds` caps rounds; a stalled/zero-post round
  goes ripe off the topic's `round_opened_at` wall-clock × `roundFireBudget` (a **state-free**
  ripeness test — no fire-counter file); a silent invitee is **recorded, never waited on**.
- **The Director** (repurposed from the old **Signal** agent — stays at 8 agents; the real-user
  intake folds in as one optional `director.signalSources` input). It **owns DIRECTION**: chairs
  the board, opens topics inviting the role-lenses, runs a sync-panel roadmap sprint (internal
  multi-lens deliberation — honest, since a loop pane has no Task tool), and **drafts** the
  kind:"roadmap" doc that the **operator publishes** (the P4 gate IS the human sign-off). PM now
  **reads** the published roadmap as its north-star and executes; it proposes direction **up** to
  the Director rather than rewriting it. Stateless per fire with **no state file** — the hub IS
  the state. `signal` actor retired to `active=0` (old attribution stays readable; new writes
  refused).
- **§17 holds end-to-end:** a discussion decision and the roadmap are PRODUCT artifacts; a
  structural ask becomes a `[director-proposal]` ticket (operator applies via git), never a
  self-edit. One bounded §0 board line added to PM/QA/Dev/Architect (gated on
  `backend:"service"` + a `director` config; fail-closed if the board tools are absent — never
  blocks). `hub/test/board.ts` certifies it (open/post/synthesize/close, invited-only,
  once-per-round, chair-gate, round-bump, closed-topic CONFLICT, attribution, isolation, and a
  §17 no-fs-tool invariant). conventions §25 + §21 reframed; hub → 0.4.0.

## 0.15.0 — hub P4: first-class versioned documents
- **Hub-native versioned documents** (opt-in, `hub.docs:true` under `backend:"service"`): the
  strategyDoc + the Director's roadmap can live as **hub documents** instead of a repo file —
  versioned, attributable, diffable, and **operator-published**. Tools: `doc.list/get/save/
  history/diff/publish`.
  - **Optimistic concurrency:** `doc.save` takes a `baseVersion` and returns **CONFLICT** if a
    newer version exists (never last-write-wins); the check+write is atomic across processes via
    `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`. Versions are append-only; `doc.diff` is a pure-JS line diff (zero dep).
  - **Operator-publish gate:** any agent appends `draft` versions; only the **operator**
    (`DEVLOOP_ACTOR=operator`) may flip a draft→`current` via `doc.publish`. So a stale north-star
    can't be silently replaced by an agent's draft — PM reads `current` until the operator
    reviews+publishes (`doc.get` surfaces `unpublished:true` for a not-yet-published draft).
    Honest: this is **cooperative role-attribution, not anti-spoof** on one host.
  - **§17 firewall is STRUCTURAL:** doc tools are **DB-only** (no filesystem path, no `fs`) and
    `kind` is a CHECKed enum of product-doc kinds (`strategy/roadmap/decisions/notes`) — a doc can
    never be a SKILL/conventions/code file. A loop self-edit stays a §17 proposal + operator git
    commit. (Verified by a grep assertion in the test.)
  - **Default unchanged:** under `service` the strategyDoc stays a **repo file** unless `hub.docs`
    / a `{ "hubDoc": "<kind>" }` strategyDoc is set; linear/local untouched. PM ports across all
    three via one §0 indirection. `hub/test/docs.ts` certifies it (versioning, CAS conflict,
    operator-publish, unpublished fallback, per-project isolation). hub → 0.3.0.

## 0.14.0 — hub P3: isolation guards, doctor, certified boundary
- **P3 re-scoped honestly.** P2 made the hub **process-per-project** (one server pinned to one
  project; every query `WHERE project_id=?`), so cross-project isolation is **already
  structural** — stronger than a per-call project arg (there's no arg to pass wrong). So P3
  isn't "build isolation"; it's closing the silent-corruption bugs that model leaves open,
  certifying the boundary, and a health check. **Membership/RBAC is DEFERRED to P5** (it
  authorizes nothing under process-pinning; it earns its keep only when one daemon serves many
  projects).
- **Phantom-actor guard:** a typo'd `DEVLOOP_ACTOR` used to silently write an unattributable
  author (`created_by`/`events.actor`/`comments.author`) — corrupting the hub's headline win.
  The server now refuses to start on an unknown actor (`exit(1)` ⇒ the MCP client can't connect
  ⇒ visible to the pane), and `save_issue` rejects an unknown `assignee` arg (Linear parity).
- **Phantom-project guard:** an unknown `DEVLOOP_PROJECT` no longer silently auto-creates an
  empty board the agent then works in by mistake — the project must exist, or you opt in with
  `DEVLOOP_CREATE_PROJECT=1`. Onboarding gains an explicit one-time create step (RUNNING.md §4a
  + init §13).
- **Unique ticket-prefix enforced** (a real multi-project bug): ticket ids are a global key, so
  two projects sharing one `hub.db` with the same prefix collide — `ensureProject` now rejects a
  duplicate prefix, and `doctor` flags it.
- **`dev-loop-hub doctor`** — a read-only health check (never auto-creates): DB-openable, WAL,
  `quick_check`, per-project counts, unique-prefix integrity, and a §17 secrecy guard (the
  `hub.db` must be outside any repo, or gitignored — it caught a real exposure in testing).
- **`hub/test/isolation.ts`** certifies + regression-locks the boundary: two projects on one WAL
  db prove a pinned process sees only its own rows and cannot get/mutate/comment another's by id;
  plus negative guards (phantom actor + unknown project refused at connect). hub → 0.2.0.

## 0.13.0 — the local hub: a `service` backend (per-agent identity)
- **A third coordination backend, `backend:"service"`** (conventions §18; opt-in, Linear
  stays the default). Routes every ticket op to a **local hub** — a machine-local MCP
  system-of-record over **built-in `node:sqlite`** (zero native deps; Node ≥ 23.6 type-strips
  the `.ts` so there's also zero build step). Full architecture in `docs/HUB-ARCHITECTURE.md`
  (vetted via design → 3-critic → synthesis; the critics forced a gated ladder P0→P8, not a
  big-bang rebuild).
  - **The win Linear can't give: real per-agent identity.** Each agent pane connects as a
    DISTINCT actor (`DEVLOOP_ACTOR`, launcher-set), so every move / comment / event is
    attributable — not the single shared Linear user that forced the §9/§23 provenance hacks.
    `assignee:"me"` resolves to that actor; an append-only `list_events` feed records
    `issue.create`/`transition`/`comment.add` with actor+timestamp (Reflect's window source).
  - **SKILLs port unchanged.** The hub MCP mirrors the Linear op-shapes 1:1 (`list_issues`/
    `get_issue`/`save_issue`/`save_comment`/`list_comments`/`list_issue_labels`/
    `create_issue_label`/`get_project`); a backend-operation audit across all 8 SKILLs +
    §6/§7/§8/§9/§10/§18 (adversarially re-checked) confirmed zero rewrite once three additive
    gaps closed: `relatedTo` (append-only, §4/§15), `duplicateOf` (scalar, §8), and a
    title+body dedupe query. Footguns are designed out as a bonus: `state` is a CHECK enum (a
    typo errors instead of mis-routing, killing §10#2), and id allocation is race-safe.
  - **CLI-portable** (MCP): any MCP-capable CLI registers `dev-loop-hub` (a `.mcp.json` whose
    `env` expands the per-pane `DEVLOOP_ACTOR`/`DEVLOOP_PROJECT`/`DEVLOOP_HUB_DB`; verified
    against Claude Code v2.1.185). `strategyDoc` stays a repo file (first-class hub docs are a
    later phase); `mode`/`autonomy` stay authoritative in `projects.json`.
- New `hub/` package (its own 0.1.0; pure-JS deps), `config/mcp.example.json`, a
  `docs/RUNNING.md` §4a service-launch section, the §18 `service` subsection + op-mapping note,
  the Reflect §0 `list_events` branch, and config-schema `backend:"service"` + `hub` block.
  Validated end-to-end by `hub/test/loop.ts` (the real loop flows across distinct actor
  processes). NOT yet the live in-CLI run — that + the kill/continue gate are next.

## 0.12.0 — operator notification on a human-park (Slack / Lark)
- **Opt-in `notify` config** (conventions §9; **absent ⇒ no-op**, full back-compat). When a
  ticket is left **human-parked** — `blocked` + `needs-pm` with `Bail-shape: external-prereq`
  (incl. a `[reflect-proposal]`, §17) — **PM pings the operator out-of-band** via a **Slack
  or Lark** incoming webhook. Fixes the failure where a parked ticket (e.g. CIT-562) sat
  unseen for days.
  - **Out-of-band by design**: the agents + operator share one Linear identity, so a Linear
    @mention is a self-mention Linear suppresses — a webhook is the channel.
  - **Trigger = `external-prereq` only** (not `decision-needed`/`scope-design`, which PM
    resolves itself under autonomy:full — paging for those is noise); **fail-closed** on an
    unparseable bail-shape. PM is the sole owner (not Sweep — no state file, lane, latency).
  - **Announced exactly once** via the new `notified` label (§4; survives state resets,
    operator-visible — chosen over a pm-state set whose reset would re-spam every parked
    ticket). Dropped on unpark so a genuine re-park re-announces.
  - **Safety**: message built from a closed allow-list `{project, id, ≤80-char title,
    bail-shape, url}` (never shell-interpolated); POST with `--max-time`, success = HTTP 2xx
    (Lark: + body `code==0`), mark `notified` only on success; on failure log one **id-only**
    line + surface in the report (no channel spam — a failing webhook delivers nothing). The
    webhook URL + Lark `secret` are **§16-class** — never committed / echoed into a
    ticket/comment/report/log; prefer `webhookEnv`/`secretEnv`. Dry-run posts/marks nothing.
- conventions §9 notify subsection + §4 `notified` label; PM Job B one-line wiring; init
  provisions `notified`; config-schema + projects.example.json `notify` block;
  README/plugin.json/CHANGELOG. Version 0.11.0→0.12.0 (plugin.json **and** the local
  marketplace.json — the CIT-562 cache-refresh gate).

## 0.11.0 — optional Codex companion (review · image-gen · rescue)
- **Opt-in `codex` config block** (conventions §24; **absent OR `enabled:false` OR no
  `codex` CLI on `PATH` ⇒ 100% unchanged**, same philosophy as `backend`/`repos[]`/
  `reports.sink`). Wires **OpenAI Codex** (the `codex` CLI + the
  [codex-plugin-cc](https://github.com/openai/codex-plugin-cc) companion plugin) as an
  **advisory accelerant** — it never touches Linear/the board (§2), never bypasses the
  gates (Dev §5/§5.5/§6.5), `mode` (§12), `autonomy` (§12a), coverage (§15), or §16; the
  dev-loop agent owns every decision and ship. A missing/unauth'd Codex is a **graceful
  fallback**, never an error.
- **Three independently-gated capabilities:**
  - **`review`** — Dev Step 5.5 stage 2 (the "`code-review` skill/command" it already
    reaches for) + Architect run an **independent second-model** review of the diff/codebase
    (`codex exec review` / `/codex:review` / `/codex:adversarial-review`). An *additional*
    pass, not a replacement for Dev's self-review; Critical/High block like Dev's own, but a
    believed false-positive is no veto (note the disagreement in the hand-off).
  - **`imageGen`** — the one thing the loop can't do itself. **Dev** generates AC-required
    production assets into `codex.assetsDir` (shipped through the normal gates; a §15
    coverage exemption); **PM** generates mockups/wireframes to sharpen Feature tickets
    (illustrative, not production). Uses Codex's native `image_generation` tool — **verified
    mechanism:** the PNG always lands in `~/.codex/generated_images/<session>/ig_*.png`
    (the named path/size is ignored and Codex's "saved to X" is a confabulation), so the
    agent copies it out; requires `--sandbox workspace-write` + `< /dev/null`.
  - **`rescue`** — Dev hands a stuck ticket to Codex for **one** pass before a
    `fix-exhausted` block (inside §9's 2-retry cap); the patch ships only if it passes Dev's
    own gates + self-review, and Dev stages only its ticket's files (§7, shared checkout).
- **Determinism for the unattended loop:** agents drive synchronous `codex exec` forms
  (`< /dev/null`, `-C <repo>`, `approval never` + explicit `--sandbox`), not the plugin's
  `--background`/`/codex:status` polling (that's for an attended operator). No secret in
  config — Codex uses local `codex login` auth (§16).
- New `references/codex-integration.md` playbook; conventions §24 + ToC; one bounded §0
  pointer per consuming SKILL (Dev/PM/Architect) with inline hooks at the natural steps;
  config-schema + `projects.example.json` (`codex` block); README "Codex integration"
  section; version 0.10.0→0.11.0. **Inward QA/Sweep/Reflect/Ops/Signal unchanged** (they
  may use a read-only Codex review for their own analysis but nothing is wired by default).

## 0.10.0 — optional Linear-hosted reports (`reports.sink`)
- **Opt-in `reports.sink: "files" | "linear"`** (conventions §23; **absent ⇒ `files`**, so
  v0.9.0 behaves byte-for-byte). `linear` routes the report **body** + the **点评** channel
  to Linear for a **cloud / remote** runtime where the operator can't reach the data dir —
  read reports and write reviews from a browser / phone. **Decoupled from the §18 backend**;
  **default-off, never the default** — it trades away a §16 defense-in-depth layer.
  - **Reports = 8 rolling Linear Documents** (one per agent) in a **dedicated** reports
    project/initiative, three fixed `## Daily`/`## Weekly`/`## Monthly` body sections with
    dated `###` entries. Documents never appear in `list_issues`, so the §2/§5/§8/§10 board
    firewall is **structural**. (No per-period docs — the MCP has no doc delete/archive;
    the rolling body is pruned in place.)
  - **Provenance by channel, not author** (the shared-Linear-identity crux): the agent's
    only write to a report doc is `save_document` (the body) — it **never** `save_comment`s
    on a report doc, so every comment there is operator-authored by construction. Hardened
    by an operator-id allowlist + an opaque `reports.reviewToken` sentinel; distillation
    reads only the operator comment's own text (never `quotedText`/body/rolled-up content).
  - **§16 guardrails (all mandatory):** Linear-bound bodies carry only summary prose +
    counts + IDs/SHAs (never captured tool/log/deploy output); a fail-closed scrub backstop
    keeps any match local-only and writes a content-free `[withheld to local]` marker;
    `signal-agent` local-only by default (`ops`/`dev` recommended) via
    `reports.localOnlyAgents`; init takes an operator attestation + warns of the widened
    audience.
  - **Mechanics stay machine-local + deterministic:** `lessons.md`, the acted-review
    ledger, the doc-id cache (`reports-state.json`), and the per-agent O_EXCL report-lock
    never leave disk; markers via `date +%F`/`+%G-W%V`/`+%Y-%m` + strict heading regex;
    review-poll coarse-gated (≤1 `list_comments`/hr/agent); assert-namespace-before-write
    guards against overwriting a real human doc; non-durable storage degrades to a read-only
    mirror (no infinite re-distill).
- conventions §22 reworded ("backend-agnostic" → located by `reports.sink`); new §23 +
  ToC; one bounded clause added to each of the 8 agent §0 lines; config-schema / init /
  README / RUNNING / plugin.json updated; version 0.9.0→0.10.0.

## 0.9.0 — reports & operator review (点评 → improve)
- **One shared reporting + self-improvement capability** (conventions §22) for all 8
  agents — defined once, referenced by a single bounded §0 line per SKILL (not 8 bespoke
  impls). Additive and **on by default**; the back-compat invariant is narrow — **no change
  to ticket / product / board behavior** (the only added effects are local report files +
  a cheap review-glob at run-start).
  - **Reports** live in the data dir, machine-local / never-committed / backend-agnostic /
    §16-bound (no secrets/PII): `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/<project-key>/reports/<agent>/{daily,
    weekly,monthly}/`. Created lazily (init may scaffold).
  - **Cadence from the reports tree itself** (newest file per level — **no new state-file
    field**), computed deterministically (`date +%F` / `+%G-W%V` / `+%Y-%m`, ISO-week-safe).
    The **daily is an append-only running log written at close** (one terse entry per fire;
    **a pure no-op fire appends nothing** — proportional to work, not the ~288 fires/day).
    First fire of a new day finalizes yesterday's; new ISO week / month roll up **from the
    dailies** (the one durable level — ISO weeks don't partition months). Gaps → `idle — no
    activity`, never fabricated. Retention ≈ 90 days of dailies; atomic-write (temp+rename).
  - **Operator review (点评)** via one canonical, spoof-proof channel — a sibling
    `<report>.review.md` the agent did **not** author (ticket / log / source text is **never**
    a review channel, closing the prompt-injection path into the firewall). At run-start each
    agent acts on an un-acted review → distills it into a `lessons.md` rule **under its own
    section** (§14), marks it acted with a **machine-owned `.review.acted` sidecar** (never
    edits the operator's prose), surfaces it in the close-report, and has a terminal
    `acted → no actionable change` outcome (no infinite re-distill, no silent drop).
- **§17 firewall relaxed, carefully**: an agent MAY write into ITS OWN `lessons.md` section
  when distilling an explicit operator review of its OWN report — the written review is the
  human authorization §17 requires. Five hard limits: own section only (`## Shared` stays
  Reflect-only), real cited review only, §14 budget, structural changes still proposals
  (`[<agent>-proposal]`), reported + dry-run-gated. **`lessons.md` is now multi-writer** →
  every edit is a **locked read-modify-write** (§18 lock) to prevent lost updates. Reflect
  stays the autonomous curator + the only agent that may touch others' sections or `Shared`,
  and its GC audits/prunes review-driven rules. **Reflect's daily retro doubles as its §22
  daily report** (no double-write); its weekly/monthly are the loop-level cross-agent
  roll-ups.
- **init** scaffolds (or notes lazy creation of) the reports tree, warns not to sync the
  data dir, and tells the operator the 点评 channel. **README / RUNNING / config-schema /
  plugin.json** updated; one bounded §0 line added to each of the 8 agent SKILLs.

## 0.8.0 — outward agents (Ops / Architect / Signal)
- **Three OUTWARD observe-and-file agents** (conventions §21) join the five inward ones,
  connecting the closed build factory to (a) running prod, (b) whole-codebase health, and
  (c) real users. All three are read-only on what they observe, stateless per fire with
  their own state file, scoped to `dev-loop` (§2), backend-aware (§18), multi-repo aware
  (§19), and `autonomy:full` = file-never-prompt (except the §16 stop-and-surface fact).
  None implements, ships, verifies, or rolls back — they route work to PM/QA/Dev.
  - **`ops-agent`** (Ops/SRE; tight ~10–15 min): polls running prod — per-repo
    `deploy.healthCheck` + `testEnv.baseUrl` + optional `ops.criticalRoutes`/`ops.checks`/
    `ops.logsCommand`. **Anti-flap**: re-checks a failing probe and acts only on a
    CONFIRMED, REPEATED degradation (cross-fire) — never a transient blip. Files (or
    REFRESHES, via `ops-state.json` + a scoped `incident` query) a `Bug`+`qa`+`incident`
    with a QA-checkable health AC, Urgent when prod is down (so Dev's §5 grabs it). Never
    auto-rolls-back (Dev's Step 6.5); an un-routable outage is filed `blocked`+`external-prereq` (§9).
  - **`architect-agent`** (tech-debt; slow, daily-ish): audits the codebase **as a whole**
    on a **rotating** dimension (architecture-drift / duplication / dead-code /
    dependency-staleness+CVE / cross-module consistency / missing-abstractions), gated by
    the per-repo SHA change-gate (§19) — on an active repo the real bound is dedup + a
    per-run cap. Reads the doc-base/CLAUDE.md baseline first. Files `Improvement`+`qa`+
    `tech-debt` (refactor safety = tests-green/behavior-unchanged is QA-verifiable, §15);
    read-only on code (CVE scans use the audit/list form); never implements.
  - **`signal-agent`** (real-user intake; periodic): ingests configured `signal.sources`
    (support inbox / error tracker / feedback channel / app-store reviews, each read-only).
    **No source ⇒ graceful no-op.** Per-source last-seen cursor + per-issue fingerprint in
    `signal-state.json` (never re-ingests; dedupes hard). Triages a defect → `Bug`+`qa`+
    `signal`, a request → `Feature`+`pm`+`signal` note-ticket (never a doc-base write).
    **PII-strict** (§16): a mandatory scrub pass before every write; references the source.
- **New sub-type labels** (§4): `incident` (Ops Bug → `qa`), `tech-debt` (Architect
  Improvement → `qa`), `signal` (Signal Bug → `qa` / Feature → `pm`). Provisioned at setup
  alongside the existing labels (§13).
- **New config blocks** (config-schema): optional `ops` (`checks`/`criticalRoutes`/
  `logsCommand`) and `signal` (`sources[]`; absent ⇒ no-op). The `models` map gains
  `ops`/`architect`/`signal` and now **defaults to `opus` for every agent**.
- **Launcher** (`run-loop.sh`): the three outward panes are **opt-in / off by default**
  (like Reflect) — `OPS`/`ARCHITECT`/`SIGNAL` gate vars + `*_SLEEP` (Ops ~10 min,
  Architect daily, Signal hourly) + `MODEL_*`; every pane defaults to `--model opus`.
- **Back-compat**: a project that configures none of this is unaffected — the three agents
  are opt-in to launch, and Signal no-ops with no sources. Version → 0.8.0.

## 0.7.0 — onboarding overhaul + multi-repo
- **`init` becomes DETECT → MAP → ASSEMBLE → LOAD** (skills/init/SKILL.md): it detects
  the project **shape** — greenfield (no code/baseUrl/build yet), brownfield (existing
  code), adopting (pre-existing human tickets) — and single- vs multi-repo; **MAP**s a
  brownfield codebase **read-only** (a Task/Explore subagent, per repo; non-fatal on
  failure) to seed the doc-base `Current state`; **ASSEMBLE**s config/labels/doc-base/
  runtime files; and **LOAD**s (operator-confirmed, per-ticket, never bulk) any named
  pre-existing human ticket into the loop. Greenfield runs a strategy interview and skips
  product smoke-tests.
- **PM doc-base** (conventions §20): the `strategyDoc` gains a fixed field set — Vision /
  Goals (north star) / Non-goals / Current state / Personas / Glossary / Decisions
  (running log) / Candidate ideas. init scaffolds the headings (seeding `Current state`
  from brownfield mapping once); PM owns them thereafter (append-only). A flat
  single-file `strategyDoc` still works exactly as today.
- **Multi-repo** (conventions §19; config `repos[]`): a product can span repos. Tickets
  target a repo via a **`repo:<name>` label** (both backends — Linear label / local
  `labels[]`). Per-repo resolution of `build`/`defaultBranch`/`deploy`/`contributorSkill`
  (repo value else top-level); `autoCommit`/`autoPush`/`autoDeploy` stay product-level.
  Per-repo change-gate (`pm-state.json`/`qa-state.json` hold a per-repo SHA map), per-
  target-repo orphan reclaim, doc-home repo (`role:"docs"/"primary"`), and cross-repo
  splitting into per-repo children. **Single-repo is 100% unchanged**: absent `repos[]`
  (or one entry) emits zero routing artifacts; normalization is read-side only.
- **Honest limits**: no cross-repo deploy barrier (per-repo or idempotent deploys only);
  one `testEnv`/`baseUrl` per product (per-repo testEnv is a known gap).
- **Version** bumped to 0.7.0; README/RUNNING/config-schema/plugin.json updated.

## 0.6.0 — per-agent models, run guide, resume
- **Per-agent models** (`models` config): the model is chosen at *launch* (a SKILL
  can't set its own), so a per-project map — e.g. `dev`/`pm` → `opus`, `qa`/`reflect`
  → `sonnet`, `sweep` → `haiku` — is applied by the launcher (`run-loop.sh` reads it and
  passes `--model` per pane). Tune to budget; omit ⇒ default model. Documented in
  config-schema + conventions §11.
- **`docs/RUNNING.md`** — the full run guide: onboarding a project (`/dev-loop:init`),
  the two launch methods (Agent View `claude agents` + `/loop` dispatch, and a local
  tmux launcher), per-agent models, cadence, **resume**, and stop.
- **Resume is a non-event** — documented: the agents are stateless per fire (§0), so
  after a stop/crash/reboot you just relaunch; state lives in Linear/the local board +
  git + state files. Agent View sessions persist across sleep; a mid-ticket crash
  self-heals via Dev Step 0 + Sweep.
- README "Run the loop" rewritten around Agent View + the model dial + resume.

## 0.5.0 — pluggable backend (Linear | local)
- **`backend` config dial** (conventions §18, config-schema.md): per-project choice of
  coordination substrate. **`"linear"` (default when absent)** is the Linear MCP, exactly
  as before — existing projects are 100% unchanged. **`"local"`** coordinates through a
  machine-local file board in the data dir (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/<key>/board/`): one
  markdown file per ticket (YAML frontmatter + §6 body + appended dated comments), state
  in the frontmatter, monotonic prefixed IDs (`ticketPrefix`, default `DL`).
- **Race-safe by construction**: the atomic claim is the ticket file's **exclusive
  (`O_EXCL`) creation** (counter.json is only a start hint); updates take a per-ticket
  lock + atomic temp-file+rename and re-read to verify; the claim uses a **per-fire run
  token** so two concurrent Dev fires can't both win a ticket.
- **Single abstraction point.** §18 maps every Linear MCP op to its local equivalent
  (list→glob+parse+filter, free-text query→substring scan, get→read file, create→O_EXCL
  write, update→locked frontmatter rewrite with the FULL label set + merged append-only
  lists, comments→appended dated section, `create_issue_label`→no-op, get/save_document
  →repo file). Each SKILL gains **one** §0 line — "all ticket ops go through the
  configured backend (§18)" — instead of rewriting any job body.
- **Firewall in local mode**: the board directory *is* the boundary (no human backlog to
  leak into), but the cross-project axis still holds — every glob stays inside this
  project's board dir, and `init` guarantees a dedicated dir. Every state move appends a
  dated comment, so Reflect reconstructs the window's activity from the comment log + git.
- **`init`** confirms `repoPath` before any write, asks the backend, and for `local`
  scaffolds `board/` + requires a repo-file `strategyDoc`, skipping the Linear
  label/project steps.

## 0.4.0 — reflect-agent + init
- **`reflect-agent`** (5th agent, slowest/daily cadence): a **meta** retrospective that
  studies the loop's *own* behavior over a window (Linear tickets by type/owner/
  bail-shape, git + deploy/rollback, throughput, QA outcomes, optional run logs) and
  **self-evolves the loop by curating `lessons.md`** from recurring, evidence-cited
  patterns. **Hard safety boundary** (conventions §17): it may autonomously edit *only*
  `lessons.md` (reversible, per-operator, never-committed); structural changes to the
  SKILLs/conventions are **drafted as proposals, never auto-applied**. The proposal
  ticket is filed `blocked`+`needs-pm`+`Bail-shape: external-prereq` so the firewall is
  *mechanical* — Dev's pick query excludes `blocked`, and PM parks `external-prereq` for
  the human, so a self-modification can never re-enter unattended implementation.
- **`init`** (setup skill, not a loop agent): one-time, idempotent, operator-present
  bootstrap — gather/validate config, ensure labels + the Linear project, verify/scaffold
  the strategy doc, smoke the test env + build, create runtime files, print a readiness
  checklist. Creates only what's missing; overwrites nothing.

## 0.3.0 — sweep-agent + prod-safety gate
- **`sweep-agent`** (4th agent, lifecycle janitor): owns the cracks between the three
  owner-scoped agents. Every PM/QA/Dev query filters by owner label, so a ticket with a
  missing/wrong owner label is invisible to all of them and strands forever; Sweep
  finds and re-routes those, resets orphaned `In Progress` from crashed runs, and
  reports board health. Hygiene only — never verifies/implements/ships.
- **Dev Step 6.5** — post-deploy smoke check + autonomous rollback: after an unattended
  prod deploy, Dev verifies prod is alive (`deploy.healthCheck` or `baseUrl`) and, on a
  repeated failure, reverts + redeploys + reopens the ticket rather than leaving prod
  broken.
- Deliberately *not* added as separate agents: `investigate`/`reviewer`/`validator`
  (folded into Dev's self-review + smoke gate) and `unblock` (conflicts with
  autonomy:full).

## 0.2.0 — jinko-brain hardening pass
Adapted the mature jinko-brain harness to our autonomy-first posture (machine gates,
never human prompts): a **prime directive** (§0) making each fire stateless-safe under
auto-compaction; **Linear MCP write-hazard** rules (§10 — labels are REPLACE-style,
verify-after-write on fuzzy state-matching); an autonomous **self-review ship gate**
(Dev Step 5.5 — spec-compliance + a code-review pass; Critical/High blocks the ship or
blocks the ticket `fix-exhausted`); a **test-coverage definition-of-done** (§15); a
per-operator **`lessons.md`** every agent reads at run-start (§14); QA **result
vocabulary** (pass/fail/drift/inconclusive — `inconclusive ≠ pass`); Dev
**orphan-recovery** (Step 0); a **bail-shape** taxonomy on blocked tickets (§9); a
**security doctrine** (§16); and a **Topology-at-a-glance** map.

## 0.1.9 — Dev split-follow-up enforcement
Dev's split rule said to *file* a follow-up for a deferred slice, but across a long run
Dev repeatedly shipped a slice, wrote "split to a follow-up — see handoff", and never
filed the ticket — stranding the deferred ACs. Hardened into a mandatory gate: the
follow-up must be filed *before* the parent moves to `In Review`, and the hand-off MUST
cite the new ticket ID filed that run; a split with no filed ID is a defect.

## 0.1.8 — PM steady-state guard
Once the structured backlog is exhausted, PM could keep re-hunting a *feature-complete*
product on every idle fire. After a real hunt comes back near-empty, PM records it and
reverts to the terse HEAD-unchanged no-op; re-hunts only on material HEAD movement or
user redirect.

## 0.1.7 — project-scope every blocked/needs-* query
The PM/QA Job-B templates omitted the `project` scope, so a verbatim transcription
issued an unscoped label query that returned another project's blocked tickets. All five
templates now carry `project` with an inline "always include project" note.

## 0.1.6 — anti-stall escape hatch
When a confirmed, reproducible defect PM flagged stays unfiled while the loop is stalled
(Dev idle, nothing In Review — QA isn't picking it up), PM may file it itself as a
properly-typed `Bug`+`qa` (QA still verifies), with repro + dedupe note. Lane-legal, to
keep the loop moving.

## 0.1.5 — `autonomy` setting
Optional per-project `autonomy` (§12a), orthogonal to `mode`. `"ask"` (default) keeps the
conservative escalate-to-user posture; `"full"` grants standing authority to decide and
act from the strategy doc — caution becomes the *method*, escalation narrows to genuine
external prerequisites only.

## 0.1.4 — close the escalation loop
A standing escalation usually resolves out-of-band (the human authorizes in a comment and
`blocked` gets stripped while a stale `needs-*` lingers). Job B now re-reads parked
tickets' comments and treats `needs-*` without `blocked` as "finish the job"; a now-
unblocked sensitive/irreversible action is executed *attended* by the owner.

## 0.1.3 — PM Job B actually unblocks
When Dev blocks on a question/decision PM can answer, PM answers it **and** removes
`blocked`/`needs-pm` (encoding any safety as acceptance criteria). Supplying the info
*is* the resolution; "answered but left blocked" is not.

## 0.1.2 — PM change-gate preflight
When In Review + blocked are empty and repo HEAD is unchanged, PM skips the expensive
product sweep and reports a one-line no-op. Records the explored SHA (not end-of-run
HEAD) so a mid-run commit isn't skipped.

## 0.1.1 — stale-doc hardening
Dedupe against the *current product*, not just tickets (§8); Dev grooming detects
already-built tickets and routes them to `In Review` instead of rebuilding; PM/QA may
file zero in a run and stay in their lane rather than padding the backlog.

## 0.1.0 — initial release
The PM/QA/Dev three-agent loop coordinated through Linear: state machine, label
taxonomy, ticket templates, priority pick order, claim/dedupe/blocked protocols, the
`dev-loop` safety label, and per-project config (`mode`, `git`, `deploy`).
